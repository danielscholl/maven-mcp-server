## Using with Claude

Once the server is set up and Claude Code is connected, you can use the tools like this:

1. **Get the latest version of a Maven dependency**:
   ```
   What is the latest version of org.springframework:spring-framework-bom 
   ```

2. **Check if a specific version exists**:
   ```
   Does version 3.14.0 of org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 exist?
   ```
